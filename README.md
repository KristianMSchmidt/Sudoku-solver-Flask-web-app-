# Sudoku-solver

Speed-optimized automatic sudoky solver using two different algorithms:

1. AC-3 algorithm (short for Arc Consistency Algorithm #3)

2. BTS (Back Tracking Search).

In both cases, a soduko puzzle is viewed as a 'constraint satisfaction problem'.

The algorithms are implemented with in Python.

I originally made the backend of this project as an assignment for Columbia University's "Artificial Intelligence MicroMasters Program. More recently, I've designed a responsive front-end and put it all together using Flask. 

The web app is live here: http://kristianmschmidt.pythonanywhere.com/.
